# What is this?
It was built as an MPV for an aplication that helps people decide on where to eat dinner. The team consisted of Leo Björkman, Jennifer Lindberg, Rita Nordström, Henrik Sirén, Anton Chen and Theodor Kraft.

I (Leo Björkman) was responsible for building the front-end and client-side logic.  

It is NOT stable and ready for production as it was only used as a proof of concept; that the techology works and that it actually can be fun to take decision in group through an application. It was used for user testing and presentations.

## The final product

Multiple people can join the same poll, get suggestions of restaurants based on their position and preferences and vote. Below you can see the flow of the user.

It was build on a private server that does not allow forks out of the organisation, as such the commit history is not included but can be shown on request. 

## Running the project

This project won't run without Google Maps API key and Firestore API key. If you want to base a project on this app or continue the development you can send a message and I'll do my best to help out.
